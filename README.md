## Air Quality Forecasting Using Time-Series and Machine Learning Models

# Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting daily concentrations of Carbon Monoxide (CO(GT)) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂(GT)) using historical air-quality sensor data. Accurate short-term forecasting enables proactive air-quality management, supports public health decision-making, and helps mitigate exposure risks.

Multiple modeling approaches are implemented and compared, including statistical time-series models, machine learning regressors, and deep learning architectures, to identify the most effective forecasting strategy.

# Objectives

  - Clean and preprocess raw air-quality data
  
  - Analyze temporal trends and seasonality
  
  - Build forecasting models for CO and NO₂
  
  - Compare model performance using standard metrics
  
  - Visualize predictions and derive actionable insights
